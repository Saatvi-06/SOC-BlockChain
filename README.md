# Blockchain Arena: Simulating Mining Wars and Network Attacks
## Week 1:
**Assignment:** Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network Construction

##  Objective

This assignment focuses on building a foundational Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network that satisfies connectivity and peer degree constraints. The generated network will be used later for simulating cryptocurrency transactions and mining behavior.

## Implementation Details

### C++ (Primary Graph Generation)
- **File:** `network.cpp`
- Generates a random, connected undirected P2P network with:
  - Number of peers between **50 and 100**
  - Each peer has **3 to 6 neighbors**
- Ensures:
  - **No self-loops or duplicate edges**
  - **Degree constraints** and **graph connectivity** are met
- **Output:** Edge list written to `edges.txt`

### Python (Network Visualization)
- **File:** `network.py`
- Reads the `edges.txt` generated by the C++ program
- Uses `networkx` and `matplotlib` to draw the network
- **Output:** Visualization saved as `network.png` and displayed on screen

## How to Run

### Step 1: Compile and Run the C++ Code

```bash
g++ network.cpp -o network
./network
```
### Step 2: To visualize the network 

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx
python network.py
```
